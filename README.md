**Project Title: 
Linear Regression for Predicting Housing Prices in the USA** 

**Overview:** 
This project aims to create a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate housing prices for different regions in the USA. The dataset, 'USA_Housing.csv,' provided by a real estate agent neighbor, contains key features of houses and their corresponding prices. 

**Dataset Columns:** - 
'Avg. Area Income': Average income of residents in the city where the house is located. - 'Avg. Area House Age': Average age of houses in the same city. - 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Average number of rooms for houses in the same city. - 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Average number of bedrooms for houses in the same city. - 'Area Population': Population of the city where the house is located. - 'Price': Selling price of the house. - 'Address': Address information for each house. 

**Objective:**
Build a Linear Regression model that takes input features like income, house age, room and bedroom counts, and population to predict house prices. This model will assist the real estate agent in providing quick estimates for potential house buyers or sellers.
